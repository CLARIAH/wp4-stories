    <h1>High and low occupations in the past</h1>

    <p>For some reason, we value fellow humans differently, giving rise to the idea that some are 'more equal than others'. The idea of unequal standing is pretty persistent, as it was already mentioned some 23 centuries ago by Plato in his 'Republic'. Three classes of people were referred to as bronze, silver and gold, but more interestingly, these classes were more or less defined by the occupations performed in these classes. Today, occupations still lead to inequality, simply because some pay more than others, provide more social capital than others and because some are regarded as more prestigious than others. Now this may be sound cumbersome, and it is often high lighted in newspapers, but the issue wwhatscholars of inequality are interested in, 
    
    
    This inequality is for example reflected in the saying that he who is born for a dime will never be w to different occupations, giving rise to the idea that some jobs or occupational positions are worth more than others.
    This is for example reflected in the saying "he who is born for a dime, will never be worth a quarter", but already

    <p>Why are some countries rich and others poor? Because economic growth is a long-term process, history is part of the answer.
      To help understand long-term economic growth, economic historians have been working on reconstructing historical national
      accounts. Collecting such data in a comparable way (expressing them in at one level of prices) was started by Angus
      Maddison. Today it is a collaborative project that continues under his name. The differences in today's world are very
      big. A small group of rich countries is up to ten times richer than a lot of poor countries.
