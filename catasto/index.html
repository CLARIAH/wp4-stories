    <h1>The Florentine Catasto of 1427</h1>


    <p>The Catasto is a tax assessment of the inhabitants of Florence and its surrounding territories between 1427 and 1429. In the Catasto, officials listed the wealth, debts, and assets of Florentine households. To see if all or most  inhabitants of Florence are included, we can compare it with estimates of historical population figures from the Baghad to London dataset. The comparison shows that the Catasto likely underreports the inhabitants of Florence, although the difference is not that large when compared to other historical tax  assessments â€“ and keeping in mind that the 55k is an estimate.

    <p>The Catasto has often been used by historians to examine the level of inequality in premodern societies. We can partially replicate these results by looking at the distribution of wealth, as measured by the total value of assets. These are the top-10 most wealthy people of Florence and their occupations.</p>

    <p>In the Catasto also households living in villages and towns outside the city of Florence were assessed, since they were obliged to pay tax as well. On average households in the city were more wealthy, yet it seems that this is caused by the presence of a group of affluent people whose assets exceeded 5,000 florins. Such wealthy households were rarely found outside the city. The share of extremely poor people - those with no assets to report at all - was actually comparable between the cities and villages of the Republic and the countryside.

    <p> The Catasto also reports the age of all individuals in each household. Ages are interesting because they inform historians about numeracy levels.
    In particular, innumeracy can be observed by â€˜age heapingâ€™: the habit of innumerate people to round their age to the nearest 5 or 10 because they were unable to calculate the interval between the present year and their birthyear. Comparing the city with the surrounding rural areas of Florence, its â€˜Contadoâ€™, demonstrates that in both regions many adults, when asked their age, rounded it to the nearest 5 or 10.

    <p> Roughly comparing both graphs suggests that innumeracy was nevertheless higher on the countryside. Indeed, the Whippleâ€™s index, a measure to compare levels of age heaping, of the Contado exceeds that of the city (308 vs. 220).

    Household size and composition is another variable recorded in the Catasto, allowing to examine the relation between household size and wealth. In the city of Florence there seems to have been a quite strong positive correlation between household size and wealth.

    How can this correlation be explained? Did these households decide to have more children and staff because they could afford it, or were poor household large because many family members were living under one roof?
