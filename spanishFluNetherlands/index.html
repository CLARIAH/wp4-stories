      <h1>The 'Spanish' Flu Epidemic in The Netherlands 1918-19</h1>
      <br>
      <p>
      This datastory uses Dutch death certificates from 1910-20 to map the temporal, spatial and social distribution of the 'Spanish' flu epidemic that hit The Netherlands in 1918-19.

<!-- openarch dataset -->
      <h2>The dataset</h2>

      <p> Thanks to the indexation efforts of archives, large parts of the Dutch civil registry (<em>'Burgerlijke Stand'</em>) are now becoming available for historians. The death certificates used here are retrieved from <a href="https://www.openarch.nl/">openarch.nl</a> (available <a href="https://www.openarch.nl/exports/5cfb55ebaf9fe5aaf216f6da1229c632/">here</a>). From the death certificates files per archive one combined dataset was created. One challenge working with these certificates is that that the same certificate may have been indexed by more than one archive. These were de-duplicated using a combination of date of death, location and similar full names (using string distances). Key variables were subsequently cleaned and standardized, such as age at death, placenames, and occupations. Using different string match combinations, place names were standardized against the <a href="https://iisg.amsterdam/en/hsn/data/place-names">Historical Dutch Toponyms dataset</a>, to retrieve coordinates and Amsterdam Codes.
      Occupations were matched against <a href="https://iisg.amsterdam/en/hsn/data/occupations">HSN Occupations</a> for HISCO, HISCLASS and HISCAM codes. All related R scripts can be found at our <a href="https://github.com/CLARIAH/wp4-civreg">Github repository</a>.
      The dataset was then converted into Linked Data with <a href="https://github.com/CLARIAH/COW">COW</a>, using the "Persons table" datamodel designed by Gerrit Bloothooft and Kees Mandemakers in the LINKS project.
      </p>
      <p> The table below demonstrates the success of the standardization efforts, presented as Linked Data.

      <p> Because archives generally decide for themselves which variables from the civil registry they will index, occupations of the deceased are not available for all regions. Archives from the provinces of Drenthe, Gelderland, and Zeeland are, regrettably, the only ones to have structurally indexed all occupations of the deceased for this period.</p>

      <h3>Share of known occupations of the deceased, aged eighteen and over, by municipality:</h3>
        <query data-query-ref="queries/occupation_share.rq" data-output="geo"> >
        </query>

      <h2>When and where did the flu hit The Netherlands?</h2>
      <p> The first query already demonstrated that the fle did most damage in flu in 1918, with much more deaths than surrounding years. As with most flu epidemics, seasonality played a role as well. Deaths surged in the fall in particular, with November 1918 being the most deadly month. But also in January through March 1919 many people seem to have succumbed to the flu when compared to a more ordinary year such as 1910.
