Data stories

Data stories are a new concept in digital humanities, data science and data journalism. Unlike blogs, scientific articles or newspaper articles claims are directly linked to the underlying data. Meaning you can directly look at the data yourself and even edit the output, providing a more objective 'story'. For example, during migration 'crises' data often focus on a short period at hand, comparing data from last month to the quarter before, leading to enormous spikes in the data and more importantly unfounded claims on where it will end in the future. With data stories you can edit such a graph, allowing for a bigger span in time and compare the influx to past migration 'crises', providing a more accurate view on the exceptionalism of such 'crises'.
